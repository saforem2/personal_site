    abstract = {We seek to transform how new and emergent variants of
                pandemiccausing viruses, specifically SARS-CoV-2, are identified
                and classified. By adapting large language models (LLMs) for
                genomic data, we build genome-scale language models (GenSLMs)
                which can learn the evolutionary landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
                By pretraining on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and
                finetuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we
                show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of
                concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the
                first whole genome scale foundation models which can generalize
                to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on
                GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing
                1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of
                121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS. We present
                initial scientific insights from examining GenSLMs in tracking
                evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, paving the path to realizing
                this on large biological data.Competing Interest StatementThe
