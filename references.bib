             Justice Projects},
    annote = {The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is a long-standing leader in
              research and development of high-performance computing (HPC) in the
              pursuit of science. However, we face daunting challenges in
              fostering a robust and diverse HPC workforce. Basic HPC is not
              typically taught at early stages of students' academic careers, and
              the capacity and knowledge of HPC at many institutions are limited.
              Even so, such topics are prerequisites for advanced training
              programs, internships, graduate school, and ultimately for careers
              in HPC. To help address this challenge, as part of the DOE Exascale
              Computing Project's Broadening Participation Initiative, we
              recently launched the Introduction to HPC Training and Workforce
              Pipeline Program to provide accessible introductory material on HPC
              , scalable AI, and analytics. We describe the Intro to HPC Bootcamp
              , an immersive program designed to engage students from
              underrepresented groups as they learn foundational HPC skills. Here
              , the program takes a novel approach to HPC training by turning the
              traditional curriculum upside down. Instead of focusing on
              technology and its applications, the bootcamp focuses on energy
              justice to motivate the training of HPC skills through
              project-based pedagogy and real-life science stories. Additionally,
              the bootcamp prepares students for internships and future careers
              at DOE labs. The first bootcamp, hosted by the advanced computing
              facilities at Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley, and Oak Ridge National
              Labs and organized by Sustainable Horizons Institute, took place in
              August 2023.},

                By augmenting protein sequences with natural language
                descriptions of their biochemical properties, we train generative
                models that can be preferentially aligned with protein fitness
                landscapes. Through complex experimental- and simulation-based
                observations, we integrate these measures as preferred parameters
                for generating new protein variants and demonstrate our workflow
                on five diverse supercomputers. We achieve >1 ExaFLOPS sustained
                performance in mixed precision on each supercomputer and a
                maximum sustained performance of 4.11 ExaFLOPS and peak
                performance of 5.57 ExaFLOPS. We establish the scientific
                performance of our model on two tasks: (1) across a predetermined
                benchmark dataset of deep mutational scanning experiments to
                optimize the fitness-determining mutations in the yeast protein
                HIS7, and (2) in optimizing the design of the enzyme malate
                dehydrogenase to achieve lower activation barriers (and therefore
                increased catalytic rates) using simulation data. Our
                implementation thus sets high watermarks for multimodal protein

                across various domains. With a growing number of model parameters

                prior characterizations of transformer models on high-bandwidth
                DGX machines that use TFLOPS as a metric may not reflect the
                performance of a system with lower bandwidth. Furthermore, data
                and model parallelism reveal significantly distinct training
                profiles on different system bandwidths at scale and, thus, need
                a thorough study. In this paper, we provide a bottom-up breakdown
                of training throughput into compute and communication time, and
                quantitatively analyze their respective influences on overall
                end-to-end training scaling. Our evaluation involves an in-depth
                exploration of data parallelism, scaling up to 512 GPUs with
                limited bandwidth, and examines three model sharding strategies
                among six model sizes. We also evaluate three combinations of
                model parallelism on both high and low bandwidth supercomputing
                systems. Overall, our work provides a broader perspective on
                large-scale transformer model training, and our analysis and
                evaluation yield practical insights for predicting training
                scaling, shaping the future development of supercomputing system
                design.},

                pandemiccausing viruses, specifically SARS-CoV-2, are identified
                and classified. By adapting large language models (LLMs) for
                genomic data, we build genome-scale language models (GenSLMs)
                which can learn the evolutionary landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
                By pretraining on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and
                finetuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we
                show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of
                concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the
                first whole genome scale foundation models which can generalize
                to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on
                GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing
                1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of
                121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS. We present
                initial scientific insights from examining GenSLMs in tracking
                evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, paving the path to realizing
                this on large biological data.Competing Interest StatementThe
