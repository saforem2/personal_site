      [NOTE: Update the **NEW** text below !!]: #
      <!-- I did my undergrad at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign -->
      <!-- (UIUC^[ILL]), where I got bachelors degrees in Engineering Physics and -->
      <!-- Applied Mathematics. -->
      <!-- I decided on Physics for grad school (the math GRE was brutal üòÇ) and attended -->
      <!-- the University of Iowa planning -->

      My [current research](https://saforem2.github.io/l2hmc-qcd) focuses on
      using deep generative modeling to help build better sampling algorithms
      in lattice gauge theory. In particular, I'm interested in building gauge
      equivariant neural network architectures and using inductive priors to
      incorporate physical symmetries into machine learning models.

      I received my PhD in Physics from the University of Iowa in 2019 and my thesis
      was on [Learning Better Physics: A Machine Learning Approach to Lattice Gauge
      Theory](https://iro.uiowa.edu/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Learning-better-physics-a-machine-learning/9983776792002771).

      Prior to this, I completed two bachelors degrees (Engineering Physics and
      Applied Mathematics, 2015) at The University of Illinois at
      Urbana-Champaign. My undergraduate dissertation was titled [Energy
      Storage in Quantum
      Resonators](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009698) and was
      supervised by Professor [Alfred
      H√ºbler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_H%C3%BCbler) within the
      Center for Complex Systems Research at UIUC[^patent].

      [^patent]: And resulted in a
      [patent](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=vV_1zDwAAAAJ&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=vV_1zDwAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC)
