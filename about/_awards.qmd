- Member of the DeepSpeed Technical Steering Commiittee, 2025 -- Present
  - Contributing to the development and direction of the DeepSpeed library for
  large-scale model training.

- Nominated to serve on the US 
  [**Coordinating Panel for Software and Computing**](https://imfisk.github.io/CPSC/)
  by the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society
  (APS).

- **Finalist, ACM Gordon Bell Prize in Climate Modeling**, 2025
  - Recognized for our work on  
    🌎 **AERIS** (@stock2025aeris): The first billion-parameter pixel-level
    diffusion model for global weather and subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting.
    Trained efficiently at scales from 1.3–80B parameters with our
    sequence-window parallelism (SWiPe) strategy, we achieve a sustained
    mixed-precision performance of 10.21 ExaFLOPS and peak performance of 11.21
    ExaFLOPS, scaling to 10,080 nodes (120,960 GPUs) on the Aurora
    supercomputer.

- **Finalist, ACM Gordon Bell Prize**, 2024
  - Acknowledged for the MProt-DPO (@mprot-dpo2024) project, which achieved
    over 4 ExaFLOP sustained performance in multimodal protein design workflows
    using Direct Preference Optimization.

- **ACM Gordon Bell Special Prize for High Performance Computing-Based COVID-19 Research**, 2022
  - Recognized for contributions to the GenSLMs (@zvyagin2023genslms) project,
    which developed genome-scale language models to study SARS-CoV-2
    evolutionary dynamics.
