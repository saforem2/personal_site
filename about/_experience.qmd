## üèÜ Awards and Honors

- Nominated to serve on the US 
  [**Coordinating Panel for Software and Computing**](https://imfisk.github.io/CPSC/)
  by the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society
  (APS).

- **Finalist, ACM Gordon Bell Prize in Climate Modeling**, 2025
  - Recognized for our work on  
    üåé **AERIS** (@stock2025aeris): The first billion-parameter pixel-level diffusion model for
    global weather and subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting. Trained efficiently
    at scales from 1.3‚Äì80B parameters with our sequence-window parallelism
    (SWiPe) strategy, we achieve a sustained mixed-precision performance of 10.21
    ExaFLOPS and peak performance of 11.21 ExaFLOPS, scaling to 10,080 nodes
    (120,960 GPUs) on the Aurora supercomputer.

- **Finalist, ACM Gordon Bell Prize**, 2024
  - Acknowledged for the MProt-DPO (@mprot-dpo2024) project, which achieved
    over 4 ExaFLOP sustained performance in multimodal protein design workflows
    using Direct Preference Optimization.
    - [Argonne team breaks new ground in AI-driven protein design ‚Äì Argonne @ SC](https://sc.cels.anl.gov/gordon-bell-argonne-team-breaks-new-ground-in-ai-driven-protein-design/)
