Large Language Models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm

:::

## 📄 Overview {background-color="white"}

- **AuroraGPT**: _General purpose scientific foundation model_
    - Model Sizes: {7B, 70B, ~ 1T}

- Safe, with a focus on:
    - trustworthiness, safety, robustness, privacy, machine ethics

- Multi-lingual: {🇺🇸, 🇯🇵[^riken], 🇫🇷, 🇩🇪, 🇪🇸, 🇮🇹}
    - Institutional Partnerships through TPC[^tpc]

- Multi-modal:

  :::: {.flex-container style="text-align: left; width: 100%; justify-content: flex-start;"}
  ::: {.col1}
    - scientific text
    - images
    - tables
    - equations
    - proofs
  :::

  ::: {.col2 style="margin-left: 10%;"}
    - structured data
    - sequences
    - time-series
    - graphs
    - fields

## 🔍 Details {background-color="white"}

- Llama Style Architecture:
    - [{{< iconify ph github-logo-duotone >}} `argonne-lcf/Megatron-DeepSpeed`](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/Megatron-DeepSpeed)
    <!-- - FLASH attention.  Focus on Llama2 for Year 1 (7B and 70B targets) -->
- Performant training implementations of AuroraGPT architecture on
    - {Aurora, Polaris, Cerebras, SambaNova}
- Workflow to capture:
    - loss curves
    - snapshots, checkpoints
    - scaling / performance data
- Training runs for AuroraGPT-7B [(ongoing)]{.dim-text}
    - Baseline (Dolma) @ {Aurora, Polaris} [(twins for debugging)]{.dim-text}
    - Baseline + Science @ Aurora
- Trained raw models 📮 delivered to post-pretraining team
    - AuroraGPT-7B-A, AuroraGPT-7B-P, AuroraGPT-7B-S  
      (A=`Aurora`, P=`Polaris`, S=`Science`)

## 🤔 Why? {background-color="white"}

- **For Science!**
- Data-{sets, pipelines} for {preparing, aggregating, parsing, analyzing} scientific data
- Infrastructure to {train, eval, deploy} LLMs for science
    - Comparative analysis across: {models, tasks, languages, contexts, ...}
- Augment text data from the web with:
    - full text papers
    - structured scientific data[^tough]
- Safety-driven, publicly-visible, open-source approach:
    - Distribution of research grade artifacts (models, checkpoints, etc.)
    - International collaborations on AGI for science

[^tough]: Can be much more difficult than text (or even image) data

## 👥 Teams {auto-animate=true background-color="white"}

# 🦙 LLMs {background-color="white"}

## 🦜 Model Training {background-color="white"}

:::: {.flex-container style="text-align: left; width: 100%; justify-content: center;"}

::: {.col1 width="49%" style="background: oklch(from #03BD00 calc(l * 1.15) c h / 0.1); border: 1px solid #03BD00; border-radius: 0.25em; padding: 3pt 8pt; margin-right: 1%"}

✅ [**Goals**]{style="color: #03BD00;"}

- Want training runs _at scale_ to be:
    - Efficient
    - Stable
    - Reproducible

- This requires:
    - Robust data pipelines / file IO
    - Effectively overlapping compute with communication
    - Stability across {network, filesystem, machine}

- For larger models:
    - Multi-dimensional parallelism strategies

:::

::: {.col2 width="49%" style="background: oklch(from #E90102 calc(l * 1.15) c h / 0.1); border: 1px solid #E90102; border-radius: 0.25em; padding: 3pt 8pt; margin-left: 1%;"}

❌ [**Difficulties**]{style="color: #E90102;"}

- _Looong time_ to train

- Stability issues
    - Failures are **expensive** [(and unavoidable)]{.dim-text}
    - stragglers common at scale

- Individual jobs are:
    - **fragile**
    - only as good as the worst rank
    - one hang or bad worker can crash job
    - network / filesystem / other-user(s) dependent

:::

## 🚀 Training at Scale

::: {.flex-container}

::: {.col1}
- 3D Parallelism
- Highly optimized GPU kernels
- Network performance
- Cost / benefits of different collective communication algorithms
    - depend on optimized / efficient implementations
:::

::: {.col2}
- Large batch training
- Second order optimizers
- State space models
- Sub-quadratic attention (?)

## ♻️  Life Cycle of the LLM {background-color="white"}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### 📝 Pre-training {auto-animate=true background-color="white"}

::: {#fig-pretrain-one style="text-align: left;"}

![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/03-gpt3-training-step-back-prop.gif)

**Pre-training**: Virtually all of the compute used during pretraining phase

:::

### 🎀 Fine-Tuning {auto-animate=true background-color="white"}

::: {#fig-pretrain-two style="text-align: left;"}

[![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/10-gpt3-fine-tuning.gif)](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/){width="90%"}

**Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuning actually updates the model's weights to make the model better at a certain task.
