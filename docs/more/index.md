  📍 How I got here

  </summary>

  My [current research](https://saforem2.github.io/l2hmc-qcd) focuses on
  using deep generative modeling to help build better sampling
  algorithms in lattice gauge theory. In particular, I’m interested in
  building gauge equivariant neural network architectures and using
  inductive priors to incorporate physical symmetries into machine
  learning models.

  <br>

  I received my PhD in Physics from the University of Iowa in 2019 and
  my thesis was on [Learning Better Physics: A Machine Learning Approach
  to Lattice Gauge
  Theory](https://iro.uiowa.edu/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Learning-better-physics-a-machine-learning/9983776792002771).

  <br>

  Prior to this, I completed two bachelors degrees (Engineering Physics
  and Applied Mathematics, 2015) at The University of Illinois at
  Urbana-Champaign. My undergraduate dissertation was titled [Energy
  Storage in Quantum
  Resonators](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009698) and was
  supervised by Professor [Alfred
  Hübler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_H%C3%BCbler) within the
  Center for Complex Systems Research at UIUC.

  This work ultimately resulted in a
  [patent](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=vV_1zDwAAAAJ&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=vV_1zDwAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC)
