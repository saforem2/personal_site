Looking at why the performance of the 7B Production run @ 64 Nodes on Aurora seems to have decreased since switching to the Q2 frameworks drop.


- Q1 Drop:

    ```bash
    module use /soft/modulefiles
    module load frameworks/2024.1
    ```

- Q2 Drop:

    ```bash
    $ module use /home/jmitche1/anl_release/aurora/2024/q3 ; module load frameworks_2024_8.lua
    ```

So, I ran some experiments on 2 nodes comparing the performance between the two environments.
