This tutorial covers the basics of neural networks (aka ‚Äúdeep
learning‚Äù), which is a technique within machine learning that tends to
outperform other techniques when dealing with a large amount of data.

- üéØ **Goals**:
  - Introduce deep learning fundamentals through hands-on activities
  - Provide the necessary background for the rest of the project
- üìñ **Definitions**:
  - *Artificial intelligence* (AI) is a set of approaches to solving
    complex problems by imitating the brain‚Äôs ability to learn.
  - *Machine learning* (ML) is the field of study that gives computers
    the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
    (i.e.¬†learning patterns instead of writing down rules.) Arguably,
    machine learning is now a subfield of AI.
- ü§î **Recap**: Last week, we learned about using linear regression to
  predict the sale price of a house. We fit a function to the dataset:
  - Input: above ground square feet
  - Output: sale price
  - Function type: linear
  - Loss function: mean squared error
  - Optimization algorithm: stochastic gradient descent

  This week, we‚Äôll work on a ‚Äúclassification‚Äù problem, which means that
  we have a category label for each data point, and we fit a function
  that can categorize inputs.

The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains
thousands of examples of handwritten numbers, with each digit labeled
0-9.

We‚Äôll start with the MNIST problem in this notebook:

Next week, we‚Äôll learn about other types of neural networks.
