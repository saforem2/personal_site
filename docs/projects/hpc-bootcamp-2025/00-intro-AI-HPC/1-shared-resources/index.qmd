Supercomputers contain many computer _nodes_ and not every application will use
ALL of them.
Therefore, we use programs called _schedulers_ that allow users to schedule a
_job_ based on how many nodes they need for a specified time.

A _job_ is defined by a user and requires these parameters to be defined:

run-time
: How long will this _job_ run? 5 minutes? 60 minutes? 6 hours?

number-of-nodes
: How many compute _nodes_ does the application need to run? 5 nodes? 100
nodes? 1000 nodes?

## Polaris Activity Webpage

- We have a page that shows all the current activity on Polaris.
  The top of the page shows a graphical representation of all nodes.
  Colors indicate a _job_ running on that _node_.
  Below the graphic there is a table that lists _running_ and _queued_ jobs.
  - _running_ refers to jobs running right now on comptuer nodes.
    If you hover on a colored node in the graphic, it will highlight all the
  nodes used by the same job AND the job in the _running_ table below.
  - _queued_ jobs are waiting for an opening in which to run.
