I’d like to try and post more this year.

Ideally these would be less-polished, more-frequent updates on what I’m
thinking about / working on.

## Ongoing Projects

- [**AuroraGPT**](https://auroragpt.anl.gov): Large Language Models for
  Scientific Applications on leadership-class supercomputers[^1].

  Additional details can be found in some of my recent talks:

  - [AuroraGPT: Training Foundation Models on
    Supercomputers](https://samforeman.me/talks/2026/12/16/)

  - [Training Foundation Models on
    Supercomputers](https://samforeman.me/talks/2025/10/24/)

- [**AERIS**: Argonne Earth Systems Model for Reliable and Skillful
  Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13523) (Hatanpää et al.
  (2025)).

  Foundation models for Earth system science, pushing on coupled
  modeling, uncertainty, and long-horizon prediction. Additional details
  can be found in some of my recent talks:

  - [AERIS: Argonne’s Earth Systems
    Model](https://samforeman.me/talks/2026/10/08/)

  - [Training Foundation Models on
    Supercomputers](https://samforeman.me/talks/2025/10/24/)

- 🍋 [`ezpz`](https://saforem2.github.io/ezpz): A growing collection of
  utilities for launching, instrumenting, and debugging distributed jobs
  on real HPC systems.  
  This started as glue code and turned into infrastructure. A dedicated
  post is coming.

- [**Genesis Project**](https://genesis.energy.gov/)

  - [The American Science Cloud
    (AmSC)](https://american-science-cloud.github.io/amsc-site/): A
    Platform for Transformative Science

    Cornerstone of the Genesis Mission’s Platform infrastructure,
    hosting and distributing AI models and scientific data to the
    broader research community. AmSC will enable the National Labs,
    industry, and research partners to curate and apply DOE’s extensive
    AI-ready scientific data.

    Cornerstone of the Genesis Mission’s AI models and data efforts,
    will build and deploy self-improving AI models that advance science,
    engineering, and energy missions by harnessing DOE’s unique data,
    facilities, and expertise. Selected teams will develop foundational
    capabilities needed across multiple scientific and engineering
    domains.

## Additional Involvements

- [**DeepSpeed Technical Steering
  Committee**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412334024578375680/)[^2]

- [**CPSC**](https://imfisk.github.io/CPSC/): Member of the Coordinating
  Panel for Software and Computing

  More info

  </summary>

  The Coordinating Panel for Software and Computing (CPSC) serves as a
  forum for the U.S. high energy physics (HEP) community to address
  shared challenges in scientific computing.

  Hosted by the Division of Particles and Fields (DPF) of the American
  Physical Society(APS), the panel brings together researchers,
  developers, institutions, and industry partners to strengthen the
  software and computing ecosystem that underpins modern HEP research.
  Through coordination, advocacy, and community-building, CPSC works to
  foster innovation, support career development, and ensure the
  computing infrastructure evolves to meet the demands of current and
  future experiments.
