I like headings.
They help organize content and make it easier to read.

Inspired by my neovim config, I wanted to recreate a similar style for
headings in my website.

::: {#fig-headings-neovim layout-ncol=2}

![Light Theme](/assets/nvim-headings-light.png){#fig-light-theme}

![Dark Theme](/assets/nvim-headings-dark.png){#fig-dark-theme}

My neovim headings in light and dark themes.
:::

I think they turned out pretty well!

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6
