## Update: 2024-06-16

After an interactive debug session with Intel, the root behavior of the apparent
discrepancy was identified.

In particular, we found that the
[ALCF/Megatron-DeepSpeed](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/Megatron-DeepSpeed)
repo was **NOT** explicitly setting the dropout values to `0.0` (and so, was
using the default values of `0.1`) for both `--attention-dropout` and
`--hidden-dropout`.

After making this change, the losses were observed to agree, as can be seen
below in 

::: {#fig-flash-attn-dropout-fix}

![](./assets/flash-attn/flash-attn-dropout-fix.png)

After correctly setting the dropout values, the loss curves were observed to
agree.

:::

## 🐛 Impact on Loss \[Bug?\]

In the `q4-drop`, it was observed that toggling `flash-attn` on / off seemed to produce different loss curves (with otherwise *identical configs*)

```yaml {filename="shared-config.yaml" code-line-numbers="true"}
TP: 1
PP: 1
GAS: 1
OPT: adamw
dtype: bf16
NLAYERS: 10
MICRO_BATCH: 2
WORLD_SIZE: 24
```

This can be seen clearly in the figure below:

![](./assets/flash-attn/flash-attn-bug-q4-drop-sunspot-1.png)

This was identified, and to be addressed in upcoming release.

### 📸 flash 🤝 📷 no-flash

With this new release, Intel observed that the loss curves agreed exactly for `flash` / no-`flash`, using the learning rate settings below:

```yaml
lr: 0.00015
lr_warmup_frac: 0.01
lr_decay_iters: 320000
```

Testing with Jerome's new release:

```sh
module use -a /home/jmitche1/anl_release/2024/q2
module load frameworks_2024_5_v2
```

I was able to independently confirm these results, shown in [📸 `flash` 🤝 📷 `no-flash`](#📸%20flash%20🤝%20📷%20no-flash) below.

### 🚧 Broken MPI[^gremlins]

For whatever reason, things seemed to have spontaneously broken on the night of
2024-04-14 ??

[^gremlins]: [Gremlins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlin), likely

When trying to run experiments the following day (05/15/2024) I was met with
this[^mpi-issue]:

```sh
Abort(15): Fatal error in internal_Init_thread: Other MPI error
```

[^mpi-issue]: https://github.com/pmodels/mpich/pull/7001

which was discussed further in [this thread](https://github.com/pmodels/mpich/pull/7001) on slack.

It seems Subrata also encountered a similar issue \[see: [slack thread](https://cels-anl.slack.com/archives/C047E7ZTUUF/p1715985162970119)\]

<details closed><summary>✅ <code>mpi4py</code> fix</summary>

<!-- `mpi4py` fix -->

To resolve this

```sh
Abort(15): Fatal error in internal_Init_thread: Other MPI error
```

issue we can simply load the correct modules:

```sh
module use -a /home/jmitche1/anl_release/2024/q2
module load frameworks_2024_5_v2
module use /home/ftartagl/graphics-compute-runtime/modulefiles
module load graphics-compute-runtime/agama-ci-devel-803.29 
module load spack-pe-gcc/0.6.1-23.275.2 gcc/12.2.0
module use /soft/preview-modulefiles/24.086.0
module load oneapi/release/2024.04.15.001
```

## 🕵🏻‍  Framework Comparison

As I was re-building MPI, and after talking to Jerome, I realized that _most_ of
the dependencies are already present in the provided `frameworks/` modules on
Sunspot.

As a simple test, I tried building a new environment built on the base `conda`
environment[^2024-0] provided by the`frameworks/2023.12.15.001` module, which worked without modification and had ) _most_ of what I needed already installed:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> torch.__version__
'2.1.0a0+cxx11.abi'
>>> import intel_extension_for_pytorch as ipex
>>> ipex.__version__
'2.1.10+xpu'
>>> from mpi4py import MPI
```

[^2024-0]: Explicitly, `aurora_nre_models_frameworks-2024.0`, abbreviated as `2024.0`

The remaining dependencies were installed according to the instructions from the **new** release `frameworks_2024_5_v2`.

Details included below.

<details closed><summary>📦 <code>pip</code> Install Dependencies</summary>


Unfortunately, the `frameworks/**` don't appear to provide DeepSpeed.

We can create a virtual environment on top of the base conda by

```sh
$ module use frameworks/2023.12.15.001
$ export PBS_O_WORKDIR=$(pwd) ; source ALCF/helpers.sh && setup_venv_from_conda
```

Once the `venv` has been created and activated, we can install the remaining dependencies:

To build / install DeepSpeed, along with its required dependencies:

- `intel-extension-for-deepspeed`:

	```sh
	python3 -m pip install intel_extension_for_pytorch_deepspeed\=\=2.1.30 -f "https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/intel-extension-for-pytorch-deepspeed/"
	```

- `DeepSpeed`:

	```sh
	echo "build deepspeed"
	git clone https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed.git
	cd DeepSpeed
	git remote add yizhou_ds https://github.com/YizhouZ/DeepSpeed.git
	git fetch yizhou_ds
	git checkout yizhou/kernel_path
	pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
	python setup.py develop |& tee build.log
	```


- Extras:

	```sh
	python3 -m pip install transformers datasets python-etcd tensorboardX packaging sentencepiece bitsandbytes tiktoken neural-speed einops intel-extension-for-transformers
	```


</details>

Looking around the available modules a bit, I noticed a newer frameworks release (`frameworks/2024.04.15.002`) that had a newer version of both `torch` and `ipex`:

```sh
module use /soft/preview-modulefiles/24.086.0
module load frameworks/2024.04.15.002.lua
python3 -c 'from mpi4py import MPI; print(MPI.__file__)'
# /soft/datascience/aurora_nre_models_frameworks-2024.1_preview_u1/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mpi4py/MPI.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
```

```python
>>> import torch
>>> torch.__version__
'2.1.0.post2+cxx11.abi'
>>> import intel_extension_for_pytorch as ipex
>>> ipex.__version__
'2.1.30+xpu'
>>> from mpi4py import MPI; print(MPI.__file__)
/soft/datascience/aurora_nre_models_frameworks-2024.1_preview_u1/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mpi4py/MPI.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
```

The remaining dependencies were installed identically to what was just done
previously for the `frameworks/2023.12.15.001` module.

**NOTE**: In the figures below, we denote these two environments as:

- `2024.0`: 
	- `module load frameworks/2023.12.15.001`
- `2024.1`: 
	- `module use /soft/preview-modulefiles/24.086.0`
	- `module load frameworks/2024.04.15.002.lua`
- `anl_24_q2_release`:
	- `eval "$(~/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.zsh hook)"`
	- `conda activate anl_24_q2_release`

### 🥸 Fix in Disguise

Armed now with functional environment(s) for
[`argonne-lcf/Megatron-DeepSpeed`](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/Megatron-DeepSpeed),
I was able to resume my previous experiments.

From the discussion with Intel, it was hard to understand / reason about _why_
the `flash-attn` fix would have _any_ dependence on the learning rate schedule
(warmup + decay).

If the `flash-attn` fix works for a particular learning rate schedule, you would
reasonably expect that it should work for _any_ learning rate schedule.

An additional source of confusion for me was that the discrepancy in the loss
curves (seemingly) disappeared when using the learning rate settings provided by
Intel[^intel-lr], but not when using the ALCF defaults[^alcf-lr].

After thinking about it for a bit and trying to reason about possible causes, I
wondered if it might not be a mix of multiple different factors:

1. Small learning rate 
2. Very long decay
3. \[maybe ?\] somehow dependent on the learning rate warmup fraction
	1. preliminary experiments seemed to suggest this was not the case


So, I was curious what would happen if I used the (larger) learning rate value from the ALCF defaults (`lr=0.003`) with the very long `lr-decay-iters: 320000` from Intel.

These results are shown below.

In particular, for all three experiments the following learning rate settings were used:

```yml
lr: 0.0003
lr-warmup-frac: 0.05
lr-decay-iters: 320000
```


![flash-attn-disguise-decay10000-1](./assets/flash-attn/flash-attn-disguise-decay10000-1.png)
Looking at this figure ^, it appears that up until the very very end, all three loss curves agree _identically_.

However, if we look closely at the very end, it looks like there _might_ be a
_slight_ difference beginning to appear between the `2024.0` (brown line) and
`{anl_24_q2_release, 2024.1}` ({dark, light} blue lines, respectively).

Thinking that I might be onto something, I then tried again with a smaller `lr-decay-iters: 5000`.

This result is shown below:

![flash-attn-disguise-decay5000](./assets/flash-attn/flash-attn-disguise-decay5000.png)
In particular, we can now more clearly see the difference beginning to appear between the `2024.0` and `2024.1` loss curves.

Continuing on, we see this effect become increasingly dramatic with even smaller values of `lr-decay-iters`:

![flash-attn-disguise-decay-2000](./assets/flash-attn/flash-attn-disguise-decay-2000.png)
![flash-attn-disguise-decay1500](./assets/flash-attn/flash-attn-disguise-decay1500.png)

![flash-attn-disguise-decay1000-1](./assets/flash-attn/flash-attn-disguise-decay1000-1.png)
In each of these experiments, it appears that:

- `2024.0`:  
	- Not impacted by this `lr-decay-iters` dependence
	- Continue to decrease for the duration of training
- `2024.1`:
	- Impacted by the `lr-decay-iters` dependence
	- Plateaus towards the end of training
