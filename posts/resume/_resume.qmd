#### üèÜ Awards and Honors

- Nominated to serve on the US 
  [**Coordinating Panel for Software and Computing**](https://imfisk.github.io/CPSC/)
  by the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society
  (APS).

- **Finalist, ACM Gordon Bell Prize in Climate Modeling**, 2025
  - Recognized for our work on  
    üåé **AERIS** (@stock2025aeris): The first billion-parameter pixel-level diffusion model for
    global weather and subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting. Trained efficiently
